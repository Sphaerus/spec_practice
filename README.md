# spec_practice

welcome to writing-specs-n-stuff practice

in implement_logic directory you will find exercises which consist of ready specs and which requires you to understand them and implement logic so specs pass

to run exercise_1:

1. install rspec with `gem install rspec`
2. enter implement_logic/exercise_1 dir
3. run spec with `rspec name_of_the_spec_file.rb`

good luck
